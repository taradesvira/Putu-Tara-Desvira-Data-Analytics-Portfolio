# About Me
As an aspiring data analyst, I bring a keen ability to rapidly learn and deliver excellence in all aspects of my work. Holding a Bachelor's degree in Accounting, I possess a strong understanding of business acumen and have a proven track record of effectively working with data to gather insights and turn them into actionable items. I recently completed a rigorous data analytics course by RevoU, an online academy with a < 5% acceptance rate, and committed to more than 200 hours of active participation in daily classes. I have a broad range of skills in **statistics (Microsoft Excel and Spreadsheet), SQL (PostgreSQL, BigQuery), Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn)** and also working with **Jupyter Notebook**, and **data visualization with Tableau and Google Data Studio (Looker Studio)**. My unwavering passion for data analytics drives me to continuously hone my skills, ensuring that I consistently deliver exceptional results.
