# About Me
As an aspiring data analyst, I thrive on transforming data into meaningful insights. Currently, I’m working as a Data Analyst at Mirah Investment & Development, where I apply my analytical skills to drive impactful decisions. This role enhances my technical abilities and deepens my understanding of how data supports strategic goals, ensuring I effectively contribute to the company’s success.
With a Bachelor's degree in Accounting, I have a solid foundation in business principles that complements my analytical expertise. I recently completed a rigorous data analytics course at RevoU, gaining advanced skills through over 200 hours of training. I am proficient in statistics (Microsoft Excel and Spreadsheet), SQL (PostgreSQL, BigQuery, MySQL), and Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn), along with experience in Jupyter Notebook and data visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and Google Data Studio (Looker Studio). My passion for data analytics drives my commitment to delivering high-quality work that meets the needs of clients and supports informed decision-making for sustained growth.
